* https://github.com/denterria
* https://gitlab.cern.ch/profile

0) Create a repository.
1) Start a new BRANCH: Copying master to edit
2) COMMIT: Making mods and saving files changes into branch (with associated message)
3) Open a PULL request: Propose your changes with a message, request someone reviews 
   and pulls in your contribution and merge them into their branch. 
   Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches.
4) MERGE a pull request: Bring in your branch edits into the master branch.

ON LOCAL MACHINE:

git clone /path/to/repository
git clone username@host:/path/to/repository

e.g. git clone https://github.com/jniedzie/LightByLight2018.git
